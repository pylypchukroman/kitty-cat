# Kitty Cat

This project is a fun little way to show the power of an
[Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). It is a public service API that stores all
kinds of information about Cats. From cat pictures, traits, to their heritage.
It was an interesting way for me to get a good experience on how to fetch and
manipulate data from an API.
